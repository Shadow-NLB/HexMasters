HexMasters
==========
A turn-based 2D fantasy strategy game

Abstract
--------
HexMasters is played on a 2-dimensional "board" which is a grid of hexagons. Players wage war by moving their units across this board during their turn.
The strategy of hexmasters is based on a system of "rock-paper-scissors" type game mechanics. Each unit has specific strengths and weakness against other units, in addition to base stats.
Units occupy spaces on the hex grid and attack across the borders of those spaces.
